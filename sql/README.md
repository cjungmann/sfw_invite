# SFW_Invite Project

I hope for this project to serve as a template for a SaaS (Software as a Service)
website.

This project can also serve as an example of several development patterns:

- Simple registration for new accounts.

- Generating a login SRM file
  - Create SRM modes from SQL procedures
  - Using **gensfw_srm** to modify and augment
    the generated login SRM file.

- Using authorized sessions

- Managing a list of users

- Issuing invitations to new users
  - Maintain an invitation list
  - Create account from accepted invitation
